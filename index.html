         <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-left-align" style="margin-bottom:50px;"> 
           If you live in a lively cosmopolitan country, and are interested in learning about other cultures, this is the perfect place to learn how to do so. There are several approaches, but the most important is to realise that we're all simply humans trying to do our best.
This website will assist you if you wish to embrace cultural differences, learn how to appreciate cultural differences, or converse with people from other backgrounds.
         <p class="w3-opacity w3-center" style="margin-bottom:1px;"><i>What is 'Cultural Awareness'?</i></p><br>
         <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-left-align"> 
        Cultural awareness, also known as cultural sensitivity, is the recognition of cultural differences and similarities without passing judgement on people based on them. You can observe cultural variations without labelling them as 'good' or 'bad,' or 'right' or 'wrong' if you have a nonjudgmental perspective. This does not imply that you must be well-versed in other cultures. It just entails being open-minded and willing to ask questions in order to learn more rather than reacting with a knee-jerk reaction to anything you don't agree with.

      </p>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Why is 'Cultural Awareness' important?</i></p><br>
      <p class="w3-white w3-text-black w3-left-align"> 
        Australia is a super-multicultural country, which means that individuals and customs from many other countries and cultures can be seen and enjoyed. You'll almost certainly meet a lot of new people and encounter a lot of new circumstances. Increasing your cultural awareness, or understanding of other cultures, allows you to have more meaningful interactions with those around you. You're developing your empathy and regard for others, as well as celebrating your differences and commonalities. As a result, you are less inclined to treat someone differently simply because they are of a different culture or ethnicity.

          <p>Different classes and backgrounds can't change the fact that a person needs to be treated differently. People tend to set one-minded mindsets about people of different cultures, class, and backgrounds. This is simply because of what they have been learning and hearing about the other cultures and classes since day 1 of their existence. Quite literally, the misunderstandings all start from what families and the circle a person is living in. Please stay open minded and stop assuming things which are unreal.</p>
